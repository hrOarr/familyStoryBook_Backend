## Api-end for family-story-book

**Problem:** When I usually ask anyone to know better about my ancestors in my family, they can't recall so far back as I expect. So, It's bit surprising to me, it would be better if there's something where I can look deeper back of my family members.

**Solution:** The family-tree I introduce is to solve my own problems and bit of fun to me where anyone can see family insight in one place. It can better help out one to discover and analysis about his/her ancestors.
